# razebot
### A discord bot built off the Discord.js library.

Razebot is my basic framework for a new bot idea that I am working on.

Please note that attempting to compile and run the bot will result in failure as config.json is not included. 
This config contains a OAUTH token and owner ID's, therefore cannot be uploaded.

This is built with NodeJS and the Discord.js library.
The primary language is JavaScript.
