# razebot
### A discord bot built off the Discord.js library.

Razebot is my basic framework for a new bot idea that I am working on.

*Please note that attempting to compile and run the bot will currently result in failure as config.json is not included.
This config contains a OAUTH token and owner ID's, therefore cannot be uploaded at this time. An empty config will be included at some point so that you can fill it and use it for the bot.*

This is built with NodeJS and the Discord.js library.
The primary language is JavaScript.

#### *This project uses (and you require a copy of these for the program to work!)...*
* Discord.js
  > Discord.js is a library that connects to Discord and allows API access.   
  > It is developed by 'hydrabolt' and is available at https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js or on their website: https://discord.js.org/
